# Green Stocks Analysis
## Project Overview



### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to understand the performance of green-energy stocks and determine which are worth investing in. To make this determination, both total daily volume and percent yearly return were analyzed.

## Results
### The Code
The file contains two VBA scripts - AllStocksAnalysis and AllStocksAnalysisRefractored - that have different code, but produce the same output. The differences in the code means one runs more efficiently, and therefore, faster than the other. To run the script, users select one of the "Run Analysis..." buttons and enter either 2017 or 2018 in the pop-up box to produce the output. To start over, users select "Clear Worksheet" and can run a new analysis.

### Pros and Cons of Refractoring Original VBA Script
#### Pros
* Refractoring decreases time to run a program especially if running a script on thousands of stocks.
* Cleaner code
* Refractor again to improve the tickers code

#### Cons
* Time consuming
* If unfamiliar with the code or written by someone else, it may be easier to rewrite the script entirely
